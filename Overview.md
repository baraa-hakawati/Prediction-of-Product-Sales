# Product Sales Prediction

## üìä Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict retail product sales using historical transactional data. The goal is to help retail businesses optimize inventory planning and make informed sales forecasts.

The notebook includes end-to-end data science workflow: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology.

## üîç Key Insights
### 1. Sales Trends Vary by Product Category
Certain product categories such as **Household** and **Grocery** consistently show higher sales volume, indicating demand stability. This trend can inform stocking priorities.

### 2. Store Type A Generates Highest Revenue
Analysis revealed that **Store Type A** accounts for the highest sales, likely due to its size or location. This insight can guide future investments and marketing strategies.

## üß† Model Summary
We tested multiple regression models, and the best-performing model was a **Random Forest Regressor**, which provided robust predictions with good generalization.

### üìà Evaluation Metrics:
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.59 (on test data)
- **RMSE**: 1131.5  
- **MAE**: 890.4

These results suggest the model is moderately accurate and could be improved with more granular features (e.g., promotions, holidays, weather).
